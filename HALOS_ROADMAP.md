# Halo OS roadmap

Order follows the master brief's priorities. Two workstreams run in parallel on separate branches:

| Workstream | Branch | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| A — Halo OS | `halo/arch-rebase` (established OS branch; merges to `main` after VM tests) | OS, SAINT, Store, desktop, ISO |
| B — Remote access + iPhone | `saint-mobile` (worktree) | remote desktop host/relay/clients, `mobile/ios` |
| Release | `halos-release` (created at integration) | tested merges of A + B |

Status key: ✅ done and verified · 🔧 implemented, needs VM/hardware verification · ⏳ next · ☐ not started

## Priority 0 — audit and architecture
- ✅ Repository audit → `HALOS_STATUS.md`
- ✅ Keep Arch + archiso (the repo's current base since 2026-10-30; the brief's "Fedora" predates that decision)
- ✅ Remote-access design and shared protocol → `docs/REMOTE_DESKTOP.md`

## Priority 1 — critical fixes
- 🔧 Kokoro ships in the image; honest voice status; Test Kokoro / Test Whisper buttons
- 🔧 Flatpak installs in the live session (`cow_spacesize`), failure reasons everywhere
- ✅ Store live search, clear resets, stale results dropped
- ✅ Halo navigation: Back button, one level of nav, Apps no longer redirects
- 🔧 Notifications at the bottom on Wayland
- 🔧 Alt+` released from KWin's window switcher
- 🔧 Halo perimeter on Wayland (one screen-sized click-through frame)
- ✅ Storage: real filesystems once each, unallocated space separate
- ⏳ Rebuild ISO, boot test UEFI + BIOS, verify each 🔧 item in the VM
- ⏳ Ollama: verify service + model pull + a real inference in the VM; surface pull progress in SAINT
- ⏳ Health dashboard: one `core/health.py` with Working / Degraded / Missing / Failed / Not tested per subsystem (Ollama inference, Kokoro synthesis, Whisper transcription, Flatpak remote, pacman, network, GPU, storage), each backed by a real check
- ☐ Dependency manager: per-subsystem dependency manifests, detect → install → verify → test

## Priority 2 — universal app experience
- 🔧 Store cards: icon, publisher, summary; a details view with licence, homepage and up to 4 screenshots, from Flathub's AppStream API, falling back to the system's own AppStream data (`appstreamcli dump`, offline / Arch packages); cached on disk; no ratings (`core/store_art.py`, `ui/components/store_tiles.py`). The `appstreamcli` path is mock-tested only
- 🔧 Filters on search results: compatibility (Native / Flatpak / AUR / Windows (Wine) / Won't work, with the reason), installed / not installed (checked with `flatpak info` / `pacman -Q`), type (apps / games / developer tools / libraries & system) (`core/store.py`)
- 🔧 Universal installation assistant (`core/install_assistant.py`, Store → "From a file or link"): URL, GitHub release (picks the best asset; GitHub's digest or a checksum file in the release), Flathub link/id, `.pkg.tar.zst`, `.flatpakref`, `.AppImage`, `.deb` (debtap), `.exe`/`.msi` (Wine) → plan with steps, risk, source, checksum → approve → the Store's queue/`run_plan` → verify (installed + process appears) → history ("Installed by SAINT": repair, uninstall). Store installs are recorded too. A Windows app / .deb with a Store version gets that offered first; kernel anti-cheat refused. Mock-tested on Windows; needs the VM
- ⏳ Heroic + one app per source installed and launched in the VM — matrix in `HALOS_TEST_RESULTS.md` ("Installation assistant VM matrix", not run)

## Priority 3 — desktop
- 🔧 Halo Dark / Halo Light (Plasma colour schemes generated from SAINT's palette) — build 7
- 🔧 SAINT Task Manager app + Ctrl+Shift+Esc — build 7 (verified on Windows data; Linux pages need the VM)
- 🔧 Floating Halo widget, SAINT Music widget (MPRIS via playerctl) — build 7 (QML syntax-checked only)
- 🔧 Star close animation (`saint-star` KWin effect exists) — review against the brief, reduced-motion, test transitions

## Priority 4–5 — remote access and iPhone (Workstream B)
- ⏳ Host: portal ScreenCast/RemoteDesktop + GStreamer WebRTC, authenticated by SAINT Link device keys
- ⏳ Relay/signaling (self-hostable) + TURN fallback
- ⏳ Browser client, then desktop client (same protocol)
- ⏳ iOS: native remote-desktop screen in `mobile/ios` (WebRTC), pairing reuse, reconnection

## Priority 6 — OS Expansion Agent
- ☐ Extend `core/evolve.py`: repository index, skill registry cache, worktree isolation, plan/approve/test/rollback

## Priority 7 — release
- ☐ Merge A + B into `halos-release`, full test matrix, ISO + checksums + install guide
