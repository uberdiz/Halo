# SAINTOS target architecture

> Historical: the Fedora/KIWI SAINTOS image described here was retired for Halo OS (Arch Linux, archiso)
> and removed from the tree (tag `saintos-fedora-0.1.0`). Current build: [BUILDING_HALO.md](BUILDING_HALO.md).

SAINTOS = **a normal Fedora KDE Plasma desktop** + **SAINT as a user-level service** + **a thin
SAINTOS layer** (branding, launcher, control center, first-run). Every layer can be removed or
upgraded without touching the others, and the desktop stays fully usable when SAINT is stopped.

## Decisions and tradeoffs

| Decision | Chosen | Why / rejected alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Repository layout | Keep SAINT's existing `core/`, `modules/`, `ui/`; add `modules/desktop/linux/`, `packaging/linux/` | A reorganisation into new top-level packages would touch every import and break the Windows build for no functional gain. |
| Platform selection | Runtime (`os.name`, `core/platform_caps.detect_session()`) | Build-time variants would fork the code. |
| Window control on Wayland | KWin scripting over D-Bus | Wayland has no global window API. `xdotool`/`wmctrl` only see XWayland windows. GNOME-style extensions don't apply to Plasma. Downside: KDE-specific — acceptable, SAINTOS *is* KDE. |
| Synthetic input | ydotool first, RemoteDesktop portal second | ydotool works without per-session prompts but needs uinput access (scoped udev rule, user's opt-in). The portal is the "proper" API but asks every session on Plasma. |
| Service model | `systemd --user` unit bound to `graphical-session.target` | Gives start/stop/restart/status/journal with no root. A system service can't reach the user's session bus, audio or Wayland socket. |
| Secrets | `keyring` → Secret Service (KWallet) | Same code as Windows Credential Manager; no plaintext. |
| Control center | Extend the existing PySide6 Settings/System pages first; a Plasma KCM wrapper later | Reuses working UI; a KCM (QML + C++) is a separate build chain — worth it only once the pages are stable. |
| Launcher | `.desktop` entry + Plasma global shortcut + (later) a Plasma applet that talks D-Bus to SAINT | Applet needs a D-Bus API on SAINT first. |
| OS image | Decide in Milestone G between **bootc / Fedora Kinoite-style image** and **kickstart + Fedora KDE spin customisation** | Image-based (bootc) gives atomic updates and rollback but is newer for KDE desktops; a kickstart/Kiwi-built ISO is the conventional path for dual-boot installs. Both must be tested in a VM, including the installer's partition behaviour, before touching the real disk. |

## Desktop backend interface (Milestone B)

```python
class DesktopBackend(Protocol):
    def monitors(self) -> list[MonitorInfo]: ...
    def list_windows(self) -> list[WindowInfo]: ...
    def foreground(self) -> WindowInfo | None: ...
    def activate(self, handle) -> None: ...
    def move_resize(self, handle, left: int, top: int, width: int, height: int) -> None: ...
    def set_state(self, handle, state: Literal["minimized", "maximized", "normal"]) -> None: ...
    def close(self, handle) -> None: ...
    def process_of(self, handle) -> str: ...

class InputBackend(Protocol):
    def key_combo(self, keys: list[str]) -> None: ...      # already validated by the controller
    def type_text(self, text: str) -> None: ...
    def pointer(self, action, x, y, button) -> None: ...
```

`DesktopController` keeps all decision logic (matching, monitor words, ambiguity, safety) and
delegates only these primitives, so Windows behaviour is pinned by the existing tests before the
split.

Further interfaces, same pattern: `ScreenCapture`, `TextRecognizer` (OCR), `AudioControl`,
`MediaSessions`, `PowerControl`, `Clipboard`, `Notifications`, `SecretStore` (keyring already),
`SystemInfo` (psutil already).

## AI layer (Milestone F)

- `modules/ai/providers.py` keeps the provider classes; add a registry with explicit errors for
  unknown names, and per-provider model lists + pricing that **you** configure (never hard-coded
  prices).
- `modules/ai/router.py`: picks a model from objective signals: the task category, the tools the
  task needs, whether a cheaper attempt failed validation, the measured hardware (from
  `tools/preflight.py`'s probes). The planner/recovery code asks the router; it never names a model.
- `modules/ai/budget.py`: a ledger (`budget.jsonl`: time, provider, model, tokens in/out, cost,
  latency, task category, outcome — no prompt text), daily/monthly/per-task limits, a hard stop, and
  an `ai.allow_paid` switch that defaults to **off**. An escalation that made no progress isn't
  retried with the same model.

## Extensions (Milestone F)

A manifest (`extension.toml`): id, version, entry point, declared capabilities → the permission
levels they map to, dependencies, config schema. Installing or activating one requires your
approval. Each extension runs in its own process with no access to secrets, can only reach SAINT
through declared tools, and can be disabled, rolled back or uninstalled. A failed generation attempt
stays in its git branch / staging folder and never touches the active install.

## Image architecture: decided (2026-10-28)

**SAINTOS 0.1 is a conventional Fedora live installer ISO, built with KIWI from Fedora's own image
descriptions**: the same `kiwi-descriptions` repository (branch `f44`, pinned commit in
`packaging/linux/image/UPSTREAM`) and the same `KDE-Desktop-Live` profile Fedora uses to compose its
official KDE Plasma ISO, plus one SAINTOS profile on top.

| Option considered | Verdict |
|---|---|
| **KIWI + Fedora's descriptions, `SAINTOS-Live` profile** | **Chosen.** Fedora's supported tooling for live media since F40. Inherits the tested installer (Anaconda live), live boot (dracut dmsquash-live, EROFS root), UEFI/Secure Boot chain (shim + signed GRUB/kernel) and update model (dnf). SAINTOS edits nothing upstream; it adds `saintos.xml`, a rootfs overlay and a hook at the end of `config.sh`. |
| livemedia-creator + kickstarts | Fedora's previous tooling; the spin kickstarts are no longer how Fedora builds live media. |
| bootc / image-based (Kinoite-style) | Atomic updates and rollback are attractive, but the installer path for dual boot next to Windows, and recovery, would have to be built and validated separately. Kept for a later release, not combined with this one. |
| Remastering the downloaded ISO | Not reproducible; would bypass package signatures and Fedora's build logic. |

### How the layer is put together

```
packaging/linux/image/
  UPSTREAM               kiwi-descriptions URL + pinned commit + Fedora release
  saintos.xml            profile SAINTOS-Live (requires KDE-Desktop-Live) + SAINT's system packages
  saint-runtime.txt      SAINT's Python packages -> wheelhouse + exact lock at build time
  configure-saintos.sh   runs inside the image: venv (offline), import check, os-release, icons,
                         wallpaper, Plymouth theme, services. Any failure fails the build.
  build_iso.sh           the entry point (host checks -> dist/)
  validate_iso.sh        read-only structural checks of the ISO and its root filesystem
packaging/linux/rootfs/  files copied into the image as-is (launchers, units, KDE defaults, first run)
packaging/linux/branding/make_branding.py   artwork generated from code
packaging/linux/vm/      VirtualBox build/test VMs, boot tests, install-test kickstart
```

### Updates, rollback, recovery (0.1)

- **Fedora packages:** dnf / Discover, from Fedora's repositories, signed by Fedora. SAINTOS adds no
  third-party repository.
- **SAINT (`/opt/saint`):** replaced by installing a newer SAINTOS build. There's no in-place SAINT
  updater yet. User data in `~/.local/share/SAINT` is never touched by either.
- **Rollback:** the installer's default is btrfs, so a manual `btrfs subvolume snapshot` works, but
  no snapshot tool is configured by default. Kernel rollback works the Fedora way: the previous
  kernels stay in the GRUB menu.
- **Recovery:** the ISO's live session (Troubleshooting → basic graphics) and Fedora's rescue kernel entry.
- **Branding drift:** `/etc/os-release` is SAINTOS's. A `fedora-release-common` update may restore
  Fedora's copy; this is cosmetic (`ID=fedora` is kept so dnf and `$releasever` behave).
